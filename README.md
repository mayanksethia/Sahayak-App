vision app for the blind and disabled

<b>You don't need sight to build a future, you need a Vision!</b>

Blindness is undoubtedly one of the most challenging handicaps that a person can face. Sadly, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that over 285 million people suffer from visual impairment worldwide. The blind still depend on conventional handphones with physical keypads because they are unable to interface with modern touchscreen smartphones. Blind people face significant challenges when using smartphones. The focus on improving non-visual mobile accessibility has been at the level of touchscreen access. For someone who is blind or visually impaired, even basic smartphone functions like calling or even browsing through a music app presents some major challenges. Its really difficult for them to know who they are calling to, how to end the call, select the contact number, change the music they are listening to, among many other issues.

<b>Our Solution</b>
<br>
Despite rapid technological advances, little progress has been made toward improving the well-being of the blind. In recent years, the handphone has been reduced in scale from the size of a briefcase to something small enough to be worn as a watch. However, the blind still depend on conventional handphones with physical keypads because they are unable to interface with modern touchscreen smartphones.

The features and countless numbers of applications available for smartphones would be useful to the blind were they not limited by the touchscreen interface commonly employed on smartphones.

Keeping this in mind, we have developed a mobile application â€“ SAHAYAK (a vision for the blind). Our objective is to enable the blind to use smartphones with touchscreens to make calls and to browse music with ease, speed, and accuracy. We believe that with our proposed platform, which enables the blind to use their haptic mechanisms to make calls and browse music, a lot of the existing challenges could be easily solved. This innovative idea can also be implemented on tablets for the blind or the visually impaired. 

Keeping this in mind, we aim to develop a one app solution to almost every smartphone issues faced by the blind. SAHAYAK would help the visually impaired use a smartphone in the easiest way possible with built in voice assistant as well as with haptic functionalities. This app currently provides calling and music solutions and later aims to embed solutions for messaging, call back, voice assisted navigation, SOS etc.
